# Construction CSS

If you had told me that one day I'd be the author of a CSS library, even a simple one, I would have called you a joker. I _*hate*_ CSS with a passion.

But then again, I am an ALX Software Engineering Scholar with my portfolio project looming over my head. As part of the project, I needed to write the frontend for my site, and I decided to go vanilla (using plain JavaScript without any frameworks).

In the process, I found myself writing a lot of CSS. It occurred to me that it would be beneficial to compile these styles into a library of their own, which led to the creation of Construction CSS.

Construction CSS is based on Skeleton CSS (ever heard of that?) and heavily inspired by W3.CSS. My aim was to create a lightweight and easy-to-use library that looks like it was written by a civil engineer and truly was.

### Features of Construction CSS

- **Minimalistic Design:** Like SkeletonCSS and W3.CSS, Construction CSS focuses on simplicity and ease of use.
- **Customizable:** The library allows for easy customization to fit different project needs.
- **Responsive:** Built-in responsive design to ensure your site looks good on all devices.
